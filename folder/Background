The idea is to build an application that is able to obtain the color of any and every
image given as input. The project involves using panda to help the application
control and manipulate the data to help in the color detection. An important use of
panda in this project is to aid with the handling of the large CSV files and
manipulating the contents received by the application to be able to obtain the
intended result. The human eyes and brain work together to convert the light to
color and then the brain makes an observation as to what color the light is. The
brain is able to map the certain lights with their color names because from
childhood the brain has been trying to map light colors to light names. The
computer doesnâ€™t have that luxury of growing up so we will provide the
application with color dataset.
